# Safe Related Raiders - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This mod prevents raiders who are blood or bonded relations of your colonists from dying outright during raids. Instead, if they would normally die, they are downed insteadâ€”allowing you the chance to capture, rescue, or recruit them.

## Core Files Created

### 1. SafeRelatedRaidersMod.cs
- Main mod entry point
- Handles Harmony patching on startup
- Provides settings UI integration
- Uses Harmony ID: "SafeRelatedRaiders.ProgrammerLily.com"

### 2. SafeRelatedRaidersSettings.cs
- Mod settings with configurable relationship types
- Includes toggles for: spouses, lovers, fiances, parents, children, siblings, bonded animals
- Optional: ex-relationships (disabled by default)
- Notification system toggle
- Master enable/disable switch

### 3. RelationshipUtility.cs
- Core relationship checking logic
- `HasQualifyingRelationshipWithColonists()` - Main check for raiders
- `HasQualifyingRelationship()` - Pawn-to-pawn relationship verification
- `GetMostImportantQualifyingRelation()` - For notification display
- Filters colonists to living, non-hostile, player faction members

### 4. Pawn_Kill_Patch.cs
- Harmony prefix patch on `Pawn.Kill()` method
- Intercepts death before it occurs
- Checks if dying pawn is hostile raider with qualifying relationships
- If relationship found, forces downed state and heals critical injuries
- Shows optional notification to player
- Returns false to prevent original Kill method execution

## Key Implementation Details

### Relationship Detection
- Uses `pawn.relations.DirectRelations` to check relationships
- Supports all major relationship types through `PawnRelationDefOf`
- Configurable through settings which relationships to honor

### Hostile Raider Detection
- Must be hostile to player faction (`pawn.HostileTo(Faction.OfPlayer)`)
- Must not be player faction member
- Excludes wild animals (unless bonded animals that turned hostile)

### Death Prevention Mechanism
- Sets `pawn.health.forceDowned = true`
- Heals critical brain injuries to 70% of max health
- Heals critical torso injuries to 70% of max health
- Prevents immediate re-death from existing injuries

### Notification System
- Optional letter notification when raider is saved
- Shows relationship type using `GetGenderSpecificLabel()`
- Uses `LetterDefOf.NeutralEvent` for non-urgent notification

## Compatibility Considerations

### Other Mods
- Harmony prefix patch allows other death-related mods to still function
- Only affects hostile raiders with relationships to colonists
- Doesn't interfere with player faction death mechanics
- Uses reflection-safe relationship checking

### Game Balance
- Only prevents death during combat, not from other causes
- Pawns are still downed and vulnerable
- Player must actively choose to rescue/recruit
- Configurable relationship types allow customization

## Configuration Files Updated

### About.xml
- Changed package ID to "SafeRelatedRaiders.ProgrammerLily.com"
- Updated name to "Safe Related Raiders"
- Added proper description

### Project.csproj
- Changed assembly name to "SafeRelatedRaiders"
- Maintains existing RimWorld and Harmony references

## Testing Scenarios
1. Raider with spouse/lover relationship attacks colony
2. Raider with child/parent relationship attacks colony
3. Bonded animal turned hostile attacks colony
4. Settings verification for each relationship type
5. Notification system functionality
6. Critical injury healing effectiveness

## Future Enhancements Possible
- Hediff to track "saved from death" status
- Cooldown system to prevent abuse
- More granular relationship importance thresholds
- Integration with other relationship mods
- Combat log integration

## Code Safety Features
- Null safety checks throughout
- Early returns for invalid states
- Harmony patch safety (prefix pattern)
- Settings validation
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

This implementation follows RimWorld modding best practices and provides a solid foundation for the Safe Related Raiders functionality while maintaining compatibility and configurability.
